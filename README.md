Walkie Talkie 
Code specifies how can an android application can receive and transmit an audio over network but not in real time there is delay between transmission and receiver. In this project it is done by using a recorder on one end of the user, when the recording is done it transmit the voice to  other user.in this both the users are client as well as server when they are not doing anything then there are the server while when you start recording the one automatically becomes server and the otherone  become client
This code can work between two end users for more you have required addition code such that the system automatically detects the recording person such it stops the collision between mutlipe user recording there voice at the same time 
For this code to work directly you have to run this application on a pre defined wireless network and in place of "ip address of the reciver machine" you have mention the client address and then run the application.
